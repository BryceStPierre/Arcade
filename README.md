# Arcade
An arcade game featuring four mini-games built using Unity and C#.

## Play
Download the [game](https://github.com/BryceStPierre/Arcade/releases/latest).

## Quick Start
The player can explore and navigate the arcade with the arrow keys, by running when the left shift key is held, but walking while it is not. The player can also jump by pressing the spacebar while they are running. For the fun of interacting with the physics-enabled objects scattered throughout the environment, the player can throw bowling balls at free will by using the left control key. If a player wishes to start a round of bowling or an arcade machine mini-game, they must press the “E” key to access that game’s menu.

This Unity game was a group project developed for a game development course at the University of Windsor. The files featured in this repository were explicity those created or obtained by myself, while the other components of the game belong to my group members or third-party asset creators.
